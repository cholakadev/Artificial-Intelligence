            <p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, 
            is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. 
            Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment 
            and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial 
            intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate 
            with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving". As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered 
            to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
            A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is 
            frequently excluded from things considered to be AI[5] , having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities
             generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic
              game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, 
              and military simulations.

            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves
            of optimism,[9][10] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new 
            approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that 
            often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals
            (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep 
            philosophical differences. Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of 
            particular researchers).
